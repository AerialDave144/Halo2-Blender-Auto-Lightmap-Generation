A standalone script that fully automates generating and exporting lightmaps into Halo 2 maps. Requires H2Codez to be installed for automatic bitmap tag editing to work.

This script is in a WIP state. Always create a copy of your work before testing this (of your .blend project and Halo 2 Map Editor tags).

Special thanks to num0005 and General-101 for assisting with the creating of this.
